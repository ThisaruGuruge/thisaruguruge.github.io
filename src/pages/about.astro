            I'm Thisaru — a technologist, guitarist, and someone who finds beauty in how things connect.
            Whether it's a line of code, the color of a butterfly's wing, or a pattern in human behavior,
            I care about how systems work — and who they work for.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work on the Ballerina programming language at WSO2. My focus spans building libraries,
            refining dev tooling, mentoring, and sometimes challenging assumptions we hold about how things
            "should" work.
          </p>

          <p>
            Language fascinates me. It doesn't just reflect our thoughts — it shapes them.
            It creates the boxes we think in, and sometimes, if we're careful, the doors to get out.
            That's why I care about how we name, frame, and describe the world around us.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't believe in meritocracy — at least not the way it's sold. A tea-plucking woman in Sri Lanka,
            whose labor fuels a huge part of our foreign income, often earns less than Rs. 1000 a day.
            Meanwhile, billionaires are celebrated for "disrupting" systems they never had to fight to enter.
            The game is rigged — and it's time we stopped pretending otherwise.
          </p>

          <p>
            I care about reptiles, riff pedals, language, photography, philosophy, and good questions.
            I believe tech should serve people — not shareholders.
            And I believe that beauty — in code, in nature, in justice — is always worth defending.
          </p>
